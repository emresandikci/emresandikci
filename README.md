### Hi there 👋

I am a software engineer who has two years of a college degree in computer programming and an unfinished bachelor's degree in software engineering. I started my professional career as a freelance developer when I was studying at university. Since my graduation, I worked for several mid-size, corporate and start-up companies as a software developer. I am highly qualified in back-end and front-end techs for more than 7+ years. I am a curious, researcher, problem solver, optimist and empathetic, a good teammate, diligent, and also a helpful person.

🔨&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interested in javascript tech-stack (ex .Net Dev) (Node.js React.js Next.js, styled-system, styled-components and more...) 

<!-- 🔭&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I’m currently working at [FineDine Digital Menus for Restaurants, Cafes & Bars](http://finedinemenu.com) as a sr. frontend engineer -->
