### Hi there 👋

"I am a software engineer with two years of college education in computer programming and an unfinished bachelor's degree in software engineering. During my time at university, I started my professional career as a freelance developer. Following my graduation, I have worked for several mid-sized, corporate, and start-up companies as a software developer. I have over 9+ years of experience in both back-end and front-end technologies. I am a curious researcher, problem solver, optimist, empathetic, and a good team player."

🔨&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Interested in javascript tech-stack (ex .Net Dev) (Node.js React.js Next.js, styled-system, styled-components and more...) 

<!-- 🔭&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I’m currently working at [FineDine Digital Menus for Restaurants, Cafes & Bars](http://finedinemenu.com) as a sr. frontend engineer -->
